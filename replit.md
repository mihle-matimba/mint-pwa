  - At least 1 uppercase letter (A-Z)
  - At least 1 lowercase letter (a-z)
  - At least 1 number (0-9)
  - At least 1 special character
  - Only "Strong" passwords can proceed
- **OTP Verification Flow** (Signup):
  - 6-digit OTP code from Supabase email
  - 180 second code expiry (hidden timer - shows error only when user attempts expired code)
  - 30 second resend cooldown between requests
  - Max 5 resend/edit attempts before rate limit triggers
  - Max 5 incorrect OTP attempts before lockout
  - Progressive cooldowns: 5min first, 30min second, 30min+ shows "contact support"
  - Edit email counts as a resend attempt and returns directly to OTP page
- **Login Flow**:
  - Email → Password → Home (on success)
  - Max 5 incorrect login attempts before 30-minute cooldown
  - Shows remaining attempts after each failed login
  - Rate limit screen with options: Reset Password or Contact Support
  - Auto-dismiss rate limit screen after 10 seconds
- **Forgot Password Flow**:
  - Send password reset email via Supabase
  - User clicks magic link in email
  - Create new password (with strength validation)
  - Confirm new password
- **Supabase Integration**:
  - User authentication (signup, login)
  - Email verification (OTP)
  - Password reset via magic link
  - Environment variables: VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- **iOS-Style UI**: Glassmorphism design with smooth animations
- **Biometric Authentication (Face ID/Touch ID)**:
  - Uses `capacitor-face-id` plugin for native iOS/Android biometrics
  - Prompts users to enable biometrics after successful signup (OTP verification)
  - Prompts users to enable biometrics on first-time login
  - Users can choose to enable or skip biometrics
  - When enabled, login shows "Use Face ID" button as alternative to password
  - Account-bound: biometrics are tied to specific user email for security
  - Toggle switch in Settings page to enable/disable biometrics
  - Green toggle = Face ID enabled, Grey toggle = Face ID disabled
  - Works like native iOS Face ID behavior

  - KYC verification status badge displayed between profile picture and name

  - Profile Details page for view-only profile information
  - Toast notifications on profile save
- **Settings Page**:
  - Enable Biometrics toggle
  - Change Password option
  - Biometrics Debug for testing
- **Menu Structure**:
  - Profile Details - View-only profile
  - Settings - Biometrics and password
  - Help & FAQs
  - Legal Documentation
  - Privacy

  - Log out
- **User Identification Onboarding Flow**:
  - 3-step verification process triggered from Actions page
  - Step 1: Employment details (status, employer, income)
  - Step 2: Identity verification via Sumsub SDK
  - Step 3: Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy agreements
  - Saves onboarding data to Supabase `user_onboarding` table
  - Sumsub integration for KYC verification with status checking
  - Glassmorphism UI with smooth animations
- **Notifications System**:
  - Centralized state management via NotificationsProvider context
  - Real-time updates via Supabase subscription (filtered by user preferences)
  - Unread count badge on bell icon (synced across all pages)
  - Notifications grouped by date (Today, Yesterday, This Week, etc.)
  - Swipe-to-delete individual notifications
  - "Mark all as read" bulk action
  - 8 notification types: transaction, security, investment, credit, promo, bank, verification, system
